  <h1>IPv4 & IPv6 Fundamentals</h1>
    <p>
    An <strong>IP address</strong> is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network.
    A good analogy is a <strong>postal address</strong>: it helps data reach the correct destination.
  </p>

  <h2>IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>IPv4</strong> uses a <strong>32-bit</strong> address. It is written in
    <strong>dotted-decimal</strong> format, made of four numbers separated by dots:
  </p>
  <p><code>192.168.10.25</code></p>
  <p>
    Each of the four parts is called an <strong>octet</strong> because it contains <strong>8 bits</strong>.
    With 8 bits, you can represent 256 values (0–255), so <strong>255</strong> is the largest value possible
    in one octet.
  </p>
  <p>
    With 32 bits total, IPv4 provides about <strong>2<sup>32</sup> ≈ 4.3 billion</strong> unique addresses.
  </p>

  <h2>Network and host portions (subnet masks)</h2>
  <p>
    An IPv4 address can be thought of as two parts: a <strong>network</strong> part and a <strong>host</strong>
    part. The <strong>subnet mask</strong> defines where that split happens (for example
    <code>255.255.255.0</code>).
  </p>
  <p>
    This split helps devices and routers determine whether a destination is on the local network or must be
    reached through routing.
  </p>

  <h2>Classful addressing (historical background)</h2>
  <p>
    In the early days of IPv4, addresses were grouped into fixed “classes” to simplify allocation.
    This is called <strong>classful addressing</strong>. It is important historically, but modern networks
    use classless addressing.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Class A:</strong> 1.0.0.0 – 126.255.255.255 (default mask <code>255.0.0.0</code>)</li>
    <li><strong>Class B:</strong> 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255 (default mask <code>255.255.0.0</code>)</li>
    <li><strong>Class C:</strong> 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255 (default mask <code>255.255.255.0</code>)</li>
    <li><strong>Class D:</strong> multicast (224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255)</li>
    <li><strong>Class E:</strong> experimental/reserved (240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    With default masks, the maximum hosts per network were typically:
    Class A: 16,777,214 • Class B: 65,534 • Class C: 254.
  </p>

  <h2>Private vs public IPv4</h2>
  <p>
    As the internet grew, the IPv4 pool started to run out. To extend IPv4, special ranges were reserved as
    <strong>private IP addresses</strong>. Private addresses can be reused across different networks because
    they only need to be unique inside a local network.
  </p>
  <p>
    The trade-off is that private IP addresses are <strong>not routable on the public internet</strong>.
    For internet access, private addresses typically use NAT (explained below).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>10.0.0.0</code> – <code>10.255.255.255</code></li>
    <li><code>172.16.0.0</code> – <code>172.31.255.255</code></li>
    <li><code>192.168.0.0</code> – <code>192.168.255.255</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A <strong>public IP address</strong> is globally unique and routable on the internet, usually assigned
    by your ISP.
  </p>

  <h2>NAT (Network Address Translation)</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>NAT</strong> allows many private devices to share one public IP address. A router translates
    internal private addresses to a public address when traffic goes out to the internet, and then maps
    responses back to the correct internal device.
  </p>
  <p>
    NAT helps conserve public IPv4 addresses and reduces direct exposure of internal addressing, but it does
    not replace proper firewall rules and security controls.
  </p>

  <h2>Subnetting</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Subnetting</strong> is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller networks (subnets).
    It helps allocate IP addresses efficiently, reduces unnecessary broadcast traffic, improves performance,
    and supports segmentation for better security and management.
  </p>

  <h2>Classless addressing: VLSM and CIDR</h2>
  <p>
    Classful addressing wasted many IP addresses because it forced fixed network sizes. In modern networks,
    <strong>classless addressing</strong> is used, where the subnet mask (prefix length) can be chosen to fit
    the required number of hosts and subnets.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking):</strong> use different subnet sizes within the same
      overall network.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):</strong> uses prefix notation like <code>192.168.10.0/24</code>
      for allocation and routing.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>IPv6</strong> was designed to solve IPv4 exhaustion and improve scalability. IPv6 uses a
    <strong>128-bit</strong> address space, providing an extremely large number of unique addresses
    (<strong>2<sup>128</sup></strong>).
  </p>
  <p>
    IPv6 addresses are written in hexadecimal and separated by colons. Example:
  </p>
  <p><code>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</code></p>
  <p>
    IPv6 is written as eight groups (often called <strong>hextets</strong>). Each hextet represents 16 bits
    and ranges from <code>0000</code> to <code>FFFF</code> (where <code>FFFF</code> equals 65,535 in decimal).
  </p>

  <h2>IPv4 vs IPv6 (summary)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Address size:</strong> IPv4 is 32-bit; IPv6 is 128-bit.</li>
    <li><strong>Format:</strong> IPv4 is dotted-decimal; IPv6 is colon-separated hexadecimal.</li>
    <li><strong>Address space:</strong> IPv6 provides vastly more addresses than IPv4.</li>
    <li><strong>NAT:</strong> common in IPv4; less necessary in IPv6 (though still used in some cases).</li>
    <li><strong>Operations:</strong> IPv6 supports cleaner large-scale allocation and routing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Wrap-up</h2>
  <p>
    IPv4 is still widely used, but limited. Private addressing and NAT helped IPv4 scale, while IPv6 provides
    the long-term solution with a huge address space. Many networks run both during the transition (dual-stack).
