# Threat Identification

## Overview

**Threat identification** is a critical phase of a cybersecurity risk assessment that focuses on understanding the **external threats** capable of exploiting organisational assets. It shifts the assessment from an internal view of assets and weaknesses to an external view of the **real-world attacks and threat actors** that could target the organisation.

Effective threat identification ensures that security controls and architecture are designed to address **credible and relevant threats**, rather than theoretical risks.

---

## 1. Analysing Attack Patterns and Methods

Threat identification begins with analysing the current threat landscape to understand:

- Common attack techniques and tactics
- Likely threat actors and their motivations
- How known attack patterns could impact the organisation’s specific systems and services

Understanding *who* the threat actors are and *how* they operate enables security architects to design controls that are proportional, targeted, and effective.

## 2. Connecting Threats to System Weaknesses

Threats are most effective when they can exploit existing weaknesses. Identifying threats therefore occurs alongside vulnerability analysis.

Common inputs include:

- **Vulnerability scanning** to identify technical weaknesses
- **Penetration testing** to simulate realistic attack scenarios
- **Code analysis tools** to detect internal flaws that could be exploited

Linking threats to vulnerabilities helps determine where attacks are most likely to succeed.

## 3. Third-Party and Supply Chain Threats

Modern environments extend beyond organisational boundaries. Threat identification must therefore consider:

- External service providers and partners
- System interconnections and trust zones
- Shared platforms, credentials, or data flows

A key question is whether a compromise in a third party could propagate back into internal systems. These inherited or cascading threats represent a common risk pattern in interconnected environments.

## 4. Assessing Likelihood and Business Impact

Not all threats require the same level of attention. Threat identification includes evaluating both **likelihood** and **impact**.

### Likelihood

Likelihood assesses how probable a threat scenario is, using historical data, intelligence, or scenario-based analysis. Some events may have extreme consequences but a very low probability of occurring.

### Business Impact

Threats are translated into business risk by assessing:

- **Quantitative impact**, such as revenue loss, downtime, or recovery costs
- **Qualitative impact**, including reputational damage, customer trust, and regulatory consequences

This ensures threat analysis remains aligned with business priorities.

---

## 5. Strategic Risk Prioritisation

The ultimate goal of threat identification is **prioritisation**.

By identifying the most likely and most damaging threats, organisations can:

- Focus resources on the highest risks
- Direct investment toward the most critical threat scenarios
- Measure and manage residual risk after mitigation controls are applied

This enables informed decision-making within budget and resource constraints.

## Practical Analogy

Threat identification is like a homeowner assessing security before a long trip.

Knowing what valuables exist inside the home is important, but threat identification looks outward: the crime rate in the area, possible entry points, environmental factors, and third-party risks such as lost keys. By understanding these threats, the homeowner can decide whether to invest in better locks, alarms, or surveillance.

Similarly, threat identification ensures security investments are driven by **credible external risks**, not assumptions.

---

## Summary

Effective threat identification:

- Focuses on real-world attack scenarios
- Connects threats to vulnerabilities and weaknesses
- Considers third-party and supply chain risks
- Evaluates likelihood and business impact
- Enables prioritised, risk-based decision-making

When combined with asset inventory, business impact analysis, and risk mitigation planning, threat identification forms a core pillar of an effective cybersecurity risk assessment.
