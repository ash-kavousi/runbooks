# Risk Mitigation Plan

## Overview

A **risk mitigation plan** is a structured and strategic document developed to address identified risks following a formal risk assessment. Its purpose is to translate technical vulnerabilities and threat scenarios into **business-relevant decisions**, ensuring that risks are treated in line with organisational risk tolerance, regulatory obligations, and security objectives.

Rather than treating all risks equally, the plan prioritises mitigation activities based on **likelihood, impact, and asset criticality**, enabling informed decision-making by both technical teams and executive stakeholders.

## 1. Risk Treatment Strategies

Once risks have been identified and evaluated, the organisation must determine how each risk will be treated. The following risk treatment options are commonly used across enterprise risk management and security frameworks.

### Risk Treatment Options

- **Risk Reduction (Mitigation)**  
  Implementing technical, administrative, or physical controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk.

- **Risk Transfer**  
  Shifting risk to another party through mechanisms such as insurance policies or contractual agreements.

- **Risk Avoidance**  
  Discontinuing or avoiding activities where the risk exceeds the organisation’s risk tolerance.

- **Risk Acceptance**  
  Formally acknowledging the risk and accepting it without further treatment, typically with documented approval.

## 2. Tactical Mitigation and Containment

Effective mitigation focuses on protecting **critical assets (“crown jewels”)** and limiting the potential impact of security incidents through layered and proportional controls.

### Key Mitigation Principles

- **Blast Radius Reduction**  
  Designing segmentation and containment controls so that compromise of one system does not propagate across the environment.

- **Vulnerability Management**  
  Identifying and remediating weaknesses through vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, configuration reviews, and secure development practices.

- **Partial / Compensating Controls**  
  Applying alternative safeguards when full remediation is not feasible, reducing overall risk exposure.

- **Residual Risk Management**  
  Assessing the remaining risk after controls are applied and determining whether it falls within acceptable business tolerance.

## 3. Governance, Ownership, and Accountability

A risk mitigation plan functions as both a **technical control document** and a **governance artefact**, ensuring accountability and oversight.

### Governance Elements

- **Risk Ownership**  
  Each risk must have a clearly assigned owner, typically a senior manager or executive, accountable for risk treatment decisions.

- **Budget and Timeline**  
  Mitigation actions must be supported by defined funding and realistic implementation timelines.

- **Compliance and Assurance**  
  Documented mitigation actions provide evidence of due diligence and reasonable security practices for regulatory, contractual, and audit purposes.

## 4. Scoping and Environmental Context

Accurate scoping is essential to ensure mitigation efforts are targeted, effective, and proportionate.

### Environmental Analysis Activities

- **Asset Inventory and Classification**  
  Identifying systems, data types, and sensitivity levels to determine appropriate protection requirements.

- **Third-Party and Supply Chain Risk**  
  Evaluating external dependencies and integration points that may introduce additional risk.

- **Likelihood and Impact Assessment**  
  Using qualitative or quantitative analysis to estimate risk frequency and business impact, including financial loss, operational downtime, and reputational harm.

## Practical Analogy

Risk mitigation can be compared to preparing a home for flooding:

- Installing a sump pump reduces risk (mitigation)
- Purchasing flood insurance transfers risk
- Avoiding construction in a flood zone avoids risk
- Accepting minor water damage may be reasonable when mitigation costs exceed potential loss

The **risk mitigation plan** is the documented blueprint that determines which action is appropriate based on asset value, threat likelihood, and organisational risk tolerance.

---

## Summary

A risk mitigation plan ensures that identified risks are:
- Treated consistently
- Aligned with business objectives
- Governed through clear ownership
- Defensible against regulatory and audit scrutiny

When properly implemented, it forms a critical component of an organisation’s information security and enterprise risk management practices.
