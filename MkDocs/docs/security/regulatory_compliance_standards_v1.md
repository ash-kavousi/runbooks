# Regulatory Compliance Standards

## Overview

Within a cybersecurity risk assessment, **regulatory compliance standards** represent the legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations an organisation must meet to protect its systems and data.

Compliance requirements shape how security controls are designed, implemented, and governed. A key responsibility of security architects and risk owners is ensuring that technical safeguards align with these obligations and that compliance risks are understood, prioritised, and managed.

## 1. Identifying Obligations and Penalties

During the scoping phase of a risk assessment, the organisation must identify all applicable compliance obligations, including:

- Laws and regulations
- Industry standards
- Contractual and customer requirements

This includes understanding potential **penalties, fines, contractual impacts, and legal exposure** resulting from non-compliance or data breaches. Translating these obligations into business risk enables executives to make informed decisions about investment and risk tolerance.

---

## 2. Demonstrating Reasonable Security and Due Care

A core objective of compliance is the ability to demonstrate that the organisation has taken **reasonable and proportionate security measures**.

By aligning security controls with recognised standards and maintaining evidence of risk assessments, control implementation, and decision-making, organisations can demonstrate:

- Due care and due diligence
- Reasonable security practices
- Informed and documented risk acceptance where applicable

Failure to demonstrate reasonable security often increases legal exposure following incidents, audits, or regulatory investigations.

---

## 3. Governance, Accountability, and Oversight

Compliance standards also support **governance and accountability** by clarifying responsibilities and expectations.

Key governance elements include:

- Assigning accountable risk and control owners, typically at senior or executive levels
- Defining budgets and timelines for implementing required controls
- Tracking compliance status and remediation activities

This ensures compliance obligations are actively managed rather than treated as a purely technical concern.

---

## 4. Third-Party and Supply Chain Compliance Risk

Compliance responsibilities extend beyond internal systems. Organisations must consider:

- Third-party service providers
- Vendors and suppliers
- Shared platforms and integrations

When connecting to external parties, organisations must ensure those relationships do not introduce compliance gaps or inherited risk. This includes assessing whether third-party failures could lead to regulatory breaches, contractual violations, or data exposure.

## Commonly Referenced Compliance and Security Frameworks

Organisations often align their cybersecurity and compliance efforts with recognised international frameworks to structure controls, demonstrate due diligence, and meet regulatory expectations.

**Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**

Applies to organisations that store, process, or transmit payment card data.  
Defines mandatory controls for protecting cardholder data, securing networks, enforcing access controls, and monitoring systems.

**Industrial Automation and Control Systems Security (IEC 62443)**

An international standard for securing industrial and operational technology environments.  
Commonly used in manufacturing, energy, mining, and critical infrastructure to manage cyber risk while preserving safety and availability.

**European Union Regulatory Standards**

Includes regulations that apply to organisations operating in, or processing data related to, the European Union.

- **GDPR** — Governs protection of personal data and privacy rights
- **NIS / NIS2** — Establishes cybersecurity and resilience requirements for essential and important entities

**COBIT – IT Governance and Control Objectives**

COBIT provides a framework for governing and managing enterprise IT. It focuses on aligning technology controls with business objectives, risk management, and performance measurement. COBIT is commonly used to support governance, audit, and assurance activities rather than technical security implementation.

**SOC 2 (Trust Services Criteria)**

SOC 2 is an assurance framework widely used by SaaS and service providers to demonstrate effective controls over customer data. It evaluates controls against the Trust Services Criteria, including security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. SOC 2 reports are frequently requested by customers as part of vendor risk assessments.

**HIPAA – Healthcare Data Protection (United States)**

HIPAA establishes requirements for protecting electronic protected health information (ePHI) within the United States healthcare sector. It defines administrative, technical, and physical safeguards and imposes strict breach notification and compliance obligations on covered entities and their service providers.

**Essential Eight (Australia)**

The Essential Eight is an Australian government-mandated baseline of cybersecurity mitigation strategies. It focuses on practical controls to reduce the likelihood and impact of common cyber threats, particularly ransomware and malware. It is mandatory for many government agencies and commonly adopted as a baseline by Australian organisations.

*The specific frameworks adopted depend on organisational context, industry, geography, and regulatory environment.*

## Practical Analogy

Regulatory compliance standards are similar to **building codes for a skyscraper**.

Building codes define mandatory safety requirements to protect occupants and the public. If an incident occurs and the owner can demonstrate compliance with those codes, they have shown reasonable precaution. If the codes were ignored to save cost, the consequences include severe penalties, lawsuits, and liability.

Similarly, cybersecurity compliance standards define the minimum expectations for protecting systems and data, and failure to meet them significantly increases legal and regulatory exposure.

---

## Summary

Regulatory compliance standards:

- Define mandatory security obligations
- Translate technical controls into legal and business requirements
- Enable demonstration of reasonable security and due diligence
- Support governance, accountability, and investment decisions
- Extend risk management to third-party and supply chain relationships

When integrated into risk assessment and mitigation processes, compliance standards strengthen organisational resilience and defensibility.
